              In versus mode the stage you fight on is always randomly selected.

            <li>
              Random team select will wipe out any previous characters you have

            <li>
              In single player mode, if you choose one of the original 8 teams,

              When choosing an original team (ie, the teams from the original

            Rugal is accessible via debug dip 1-4. This is almost identical to
            how the original game works.

          <p className="my-4">
            To get regular Rugal, choose him with A in the order select screen.
            To get second form Rugal, push right or left until Rugal stops
            moving.

          <p className="my-4">
            Once he is chosen, turn off debug dip 1-4, otherwise both characters

          <p>
            In a single player game, using Rugal will crash the game if you make
            it to the Rugal fight. This is true in the original game too.

          <h4 className="font-bold my-4">
            Why isn&apos;t Rugal a normal character?
          </h4>
          <p>
            In the original game, Rugal is only accessible via the same debug
            dip. I decided to take that route with the hack as well. It boils
            down to he&apos;s just the boss and missing things needed to be a
            full fledged character:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-4 mt-4">
            <li>His normal form has no specials, DMs, or even a throw.</li>
            <li>
              He has no charging animation in his normal form. Pressing ABC just
              makes him disappear.
            </li>
            <li>He can&apos;t be setup on the continue screen.</li>
            <li>He corrupts palettes in his full form.</li>
            <li>
              His transformation cutscene runs after defeating his first form.
            </li>
            <li>
              He does a ton of damage and takes little damage. Using him in
              versus mode matches is pretty lame.
            </li>

            CPU Custom Teams
          </h3>
          <p className="my-4">
            Like most KOF games, the CPU can now choose a custom team with this
            hack. That means the CPU&apos;s team can be formed out of any of the
            24 characters, just like a player&apos;s team.

            alt="CPU using custom teams"
          />
          <p className="mt-8">Here are the guidelines</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-4 mt-4">
            <li>
              If you choose an original 8 team (the teams in the original game),
              then the CPU will also stick to original teams. You will also get
              the original team&apos;s cutscenes and ending. So when you choose
              an original team, the hack reverts entirely back to vanilla KOF94.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you choose a custom team, there is roughly a 62% chance the CPU
              will stick with original teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              When starting a new game, you can hold C while pressing start to
              force the CPU to use custom teams. If you do it correctly, you
              will hear &quot;go red!&quot;. This means the CPU will always use
              custom teams, even if you choose an original 8 team.
            </li>
            <li>
              When starting a new game, you can hold D while pressing start to
              force the CPU to use original 8 teams.
